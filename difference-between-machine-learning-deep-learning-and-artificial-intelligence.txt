**********
To sum up: Artificial Intelligence is human intelligence displayed by machines, 
Machine Learning is an approach to achieving artificial intelligence, 
and Deep Learning is a technique to implement machine learning.
**********

######
But if you really want to learn AI. You must learn other subjects like

    Linear algebra
    Probability
    Statistics
    Neuroscience
    Calculus

AI is a broad field. You can choose a specific field to learn like

    Natural Language Processing
    Machine Learning
    Super Intelligence
    Video Game AI
    Artificial General Intelligence

######

####
Start by learning python. Learn how to code in python and the different packages that are specifically used for AI and Machine Learning.

To name a few packages for AI:

    Tensorflow
    Scikit-Learn
    NumPy
    Theano
    Keras
    NLTK

After this, you can study the concepts of AI, which mainly include:

    Machine Learning
    Deep Learning
    Natural Language Processing

All of this content is covered in the below video, along with a number of practical implementations in Python.

The most important one is “Work on projects” After you have gained enough, start contributing to Open Source Projects. 
Here are 6 Cool AI / Ml projects with Python.
